==>> [Add Mouse Bot to your server!](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=213381103287926785&permissions=1879395392&scope=bot) <<==

Mouse Bot is a Discord bot for Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes players guilds and servers.

I started Mouse Bot as a side project mostly for myself. It started off with just the dailies command. Then my guild began to use it more often when I created the convert command. Now I’m happy to say that Mouse Bot has 22 different commands ranging from game to Discord server moderation commands. I am striving to make Mouse Bot the definitive bot for SW:GoH and I hope you enjoy using him as much as I do!

I made Mouse Bot publicly available so that people can host him on their own servers if they want to. I also highly encourage people to modify and improve him. Create new commands that help players, guilds or the community in general. (If you do make any modifications or additions, please let me know so I can share them with everyone!)

You can visit the [user manual](https://rmgirardin.gitbooks.io/mouse-bot-user-manual/) to see all the commands and how they work. You can also view how to [install Mouse Bot on your own server](https://rmgirardin.gitbooks.io/mouse-bot-user-manual/content/install.html).

A big shout-out to the [Guide Bot](https://github.com/An-Idiots-Guide/guidebot) created by Evie and York. Without their Guide Bot, I would still have a simple little one-file bot.
